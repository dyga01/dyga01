# Welcome to My Profile!
Hi, I’m Aidan Dyga. I'm a computer science and economics student at Allegheny College.
I am interested in technology and its intersection with finance. I love to learn new things, 
and I am always open to collaborating on projects and ideas. I have experience in Python, Java,
Javascript, HTML, and CSS. You can reach me on my LinkedIn if you would like to connect.
